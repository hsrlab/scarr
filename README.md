Note on benchmark results: unfortunately, after the camera ready paper deadline, a firmware update (UEFI: 1.26 / ECP: 1.18) was installed on the Lenovo X1 Extreme Gen 4 (i7-11800H with RTX 3060) that we used for benchmarking. This update substantially improved thermal management and all tested frameworks consistently perform better. Their relative performance to each other is still accurately reflected by the results in our paper though.
