# Best Practices for Running SCARR on a Laptop

* Put laptop on hard surface, not a blanket, couch, etc.
* Check if fan inlets are dust free; perhaps now is the time to clean that
* Monitor your CPU temperature to avoid critical levels
* Consider a laptop stand or other elevated fixture; some of them have a fan to support cooling
* When in docking mode, do not close your laptop to improve airflow
* Run workload while laptop is fully charged to avoid extra heat from charging the battery
* When in the process of buying new, look for more capable cooling options (e.g., vapor chamber cooling)
